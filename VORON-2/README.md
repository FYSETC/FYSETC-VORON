# FYSETC-VORON-2.4
This is FYSETC's project database for VORON2.4 , which is convenient for you to find information. Thanks for Voron Team's great work, they always design fantastic printers.

In folder `Voron-2-Voron2.4` beside this README file, we make some small changes base on the VORON official material. Like change the board to Spider and others.
